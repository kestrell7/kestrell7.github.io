<h1>Welcome to Kestrell's Disability and Technology Pages</h1>

		<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I'm a blind disability and technology advocate, writer, and MIT graduate. I write and speak about assistive technology for people with disabilities, images of people with disabilities in science fiction, and the many ways in which books are available to readers with disabilities.</p>
People often ask me where I got the name Kestrell from: my answer is, I love learning about raptors and falconry, and the kestrel is the smallest falcon, which I identify with because I'm under five feet tall, myself. I'm a particular fan of Stormfly, the resident kestrel at <a href="https://vultureconservancy.org/help/">Vulture Conservancy</a>, though the resident vulture, Sev (for Severus), is a hoot, also.</p>
